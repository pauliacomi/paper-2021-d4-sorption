  abstract = {Open framework materials (OFM) constitute a large and growing class of nanoporous crystalline structures that is attracting considerable attention for electronic device applications. This review summarizes the most recent reports concerning electronic devices enabled by either of the two primary categories of OFM, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs). Devices in which the OFM plays an active role (as opposed to acting only as a selective sorbent or filter) are the principal focus, with examples cited that include field-effect transistors, capacitors, memristors, and a wide variety of sensing architectures. As a brief tutorial, we also provide a concise summary of various methods of depositing or growing OFM on surfaces, as these are of crucial importance to the deployment of electronic OFM. Finally, we offer our perspective concerning future research directions, particularly regarding what in our view are the biggest challenges remaining to be addressed. On the basis of the literature discussed here, we conclude that OFM constitute a unique class of electronic materials with characteristics and advantages that are distinct from either conventional inorganic semiconductors or organic conductors. This suggests a bright future for these materials in applications such as edge computing, resistive switching, and mechanically flexible sensing and electronics.},

  abstract = {Designing adsorbents for the separation of natural gas components requires an understanding of how molecular structure affects gas adsorption.           ,                             With the growth of natural gas as an energy source, upgrading CO               2               -contaminated supplies has become increasingly important. Here we develop a single metric that captures how well an adsorbent performs the separation of CH               4               and CO               2               , and we then use this metric to computationally screen tens of thousands of all-silica zeolites. We show that the most important predictors of separation performance are the CO               2               heat of adsorption (               Q               st,CO2               ) and the CO               2               saturation loading capacity. We find that a higher-performing material results when the absolute value of the CH               4               heat of adsorption (               Q               st,CH4               ) is decreased independently of               Q               st,CO2               , but a correlation that exists between               Q               st,CH4               and               Q               st,CO2               in all-silica zeolites leads to incongruity between the objectives of optimizing               Q               st,CO2               and minimizing               Q               st,CH4               , rendering               Q               st,CH4               nonpredictive of separation performance. We also conduct a large-scale analysis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) by comparing results obtained using directly-generated mixture isotherms to those obtained using IAST; IAST appears adequate for the purposes of establishing performance trends and structure\textendash property relationships in a high-throughput manner, but it must be tested for validity when analyzing individual adsorbents in detail since it can produce significant errors for materials in which there is site segregation of the adsorbate species.},

Filling a fuel tank with nanoporous materials, such as metal\textendash organic frameworks (MOFs), could greatly improve the deliverable capacity of these tanks if appropriate materials could be found. However, since MOFs can be made from many combinations of metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional groups, the design space of possible MOFs is enormous. Experimental characterization of thousands of MOFs is infeasible, and even conventional molecular simulations can be prohibitively expensive for large databases. In this work, we have developed a data-driven approach to accelerate materials screening and learn structure\textendash property relationships. We report new descriptors for gas adsorption in MOFs derived from the energetics of MOF\textendash guest interactions. Using the bins of an energy histogram as features, we trained a sparse regression model to predict gas uptake in multiple MOF databases to an accuracy within 3 g L               -1               . The interpretable model parameters indicate that a somewhat weak attraction between hydrogen and the framework is ideal for cryogenic storage and release. Our machine learning method is more than three orders of magnitude faster than conventional molecular simulations, enabling rapid exploration of large numbers of MOFs. As a case study, we applied the method to screen a database of more than 50\,000 experimental MOF structures. We experimentally validated one of the top candidates identified from the accelerated screening, MFU-4               l               . This material exhibited a hydrogen deliverable capacity of 47 g L               -1               (54 g L               -1               simulated) when operating at storage conditions of 77 K, 100 bar and delivery at 160 K, 5 bar.},

Highthroughput computational screening has led to a rapid increase in property data that has enabled several potential applications for MOFs, including gas storage, separations, catalysis, and other fields. Despite their rich chemistry, MOFs are typically named using an ad hoc approach, which can impede their searchability and the discovery of broad insights. In this article, we develop two systematic MOF identifiers, coined MOFid and MOFkey, and algorithms for deconstructing MOFs into their building blocks and underlying topological network. We review existing cheminformatics formats for small molecules and address the challenges of adapting them to periodic crystal structures. Our algorithms are distributed as open-source software, and we apply them here to extract insights from several MOF databases. Through the process of designing MOFid and MOFkey, we provide a perspective on opportunities for the community to facilitate data reuse, improve searchability, and rapidly apply cheminformatics analyses.},

Characterization of the ACs included several physical and chemical techniques. The D4 adsorption capacities were strongly related with the textural development of the ACs. Results showed that the optimum adsorbent for D4 is a wood-based chemically activated carbon, which rendered an adsorption capacity of 1732 {$\pm$} 93 mg g-1 using 1000 ppm (v/v) of D4 with dry N2 as the carrier gas. When the concentration of D4 was lowered to typical values found in biogas, the adsorption capacity was halved. The presence of major biogas compounds (i.e., CH4 and CO2) and humidity further reduced the D4 adsorption capacity. The polymerization of D4 over the surface of all ACs was found to be relevant after prolonged contact times. The extent of this phenomenon, which may negatively affect the thermal regeneration of the AC, correlated reasonably well with the presence of phenolic and carboxylic groups on the carbon surfaces.},

High-throughput computational screening efforts can accelerate the discovery of new adsorbents but sometimes require significant computational resources to explore the large space of possible materials. We report the in silico discovery of high-performing adsorbents for precombustion CO               2               capture by applying a genetic algorithm to efficiently search a large database of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for top candidates. High-performing MOFs identified from the in silico search were synthesized and activated and show a high CO               2               working capacity and a high CO               2               /H               2               selectivity. One of the synthesized MOFs shows a higher CO               2               working capacity than any MOF reported in the literature under the operating conditions investigated here.},

The development of this model has illustrated clear correlations between characteristic features of a zeolite and elastic moduli, providing exceptional insight into the mechanics of zeolitic frameworks. Finally, we employ this methodology to predict the elastic response of 590 448 hypothetical zeolites, and the results of this massive database provide clear evidence of stability trends in porous materials.},

The models were tested on a large set of 292 050 MOFs that were not part of the training set. The QSPR classifier could recover 945 of the top 1000 MOFs in the test set while flagging only 10\% of the whole library for compute intensive screening. Thus, using the machine learning classifiers as part of a high-throughput screening protocol would result in an order of magnitude reduction in compute time and allow intractably large structure libraries and search spaces to be screened.},

Adsorption isotherms of D4, the most common siloxane in waste treatment plants, have been collected at different temperatures and modelled by means of the Langmuir theoretical isotherm. The selected metal organic framework shows a remarkable affinity for siloxane adsorption and an outstanding saturation capacity weakly dependent on temperature. Moreover, repeated adsorption isotherms, collected after a reactivation treatment of the same adsorbent sample, clearly indicate full regeneration capabilities. Considering that chromium-based MIL-101 is also a noticeable H2S adsorbent, the results reported in this work pave the way to its potential application for the simultaneous removal of the two main poisoning compounds contained in biogas.},

Due to the combinatorial possibilities, there are millions of possible MOF structures. Aiming to exploit their exceptional tunability, surface areas and pore volumes, researchers have investigated MOFs for storage of gaseous fuels such as hydrogen for over a decade, but a suitable MOF to store hydrogen at ambient conditions has not yet been found. Here, we sought to rapidly determine the viability of using MOFs for hydrogen storage at recently proposed, cryogenic operating conditions. We constructed a large and structurally diverse set of 13\,512 potential MOF structures based on 41 different topologies and used molecular simulation to determine MOF hydrogen deliverable capacities between 100 bar/77 K and 5 bar/160 K. The highest volumetric deliverable capacity was 57 g L               -1               of MOF, which surpasses the 37 g L               -1               of tank of the incumbent technology (compressing hydrogen to 700 bar at ambient temperature). To validate our               in silico               MOF construction method, we synthesized a new isoreticular family of MOFs (               she-MOF-               x series) based on the               she               topology, which is extremely rare among MOFs. To validate our hydrogen storage predictions, we activated and measured hydrogen adsorption on               she-MOF-1               and               NU-1103               . The latter MOF showed outstanding stability and a good combination of volumetric and gravimetric performance, presenting 43.2 g L               -1               of MOF and 12.6 wt\% volumetric and gravimetric deliverable capacities, respectively.},

The database was first reviewed to observe the basic trends and patterns. It was then analyzed using decision trees and artificial neural networks (ANN) to extract hidden information and develop rules and heuristics for future studies. Five-fold cross validations were used in each analysis to test the validity of the models with data not seen before. Decision-tree analyses were carried out using six user-defined descriptors and two structural properties, separately. The crystal structure and the total degree of unsaturation were found to be the effective user-defined descriptors, whereas the pore volume and maximum pore diameter, as structural properties, were sufficient to determine the MOFs having high CH4-storage capacity. Moreover, a high pore volume is always required, as expected. In ANN analyses, models were also developed by using user-defined descriptors and structural properties separately. It was observed that the user-defined descriptors were not sufficient to describe the CH4-storage capacities of MOFs, whereas the structural properties in particular led to accurate CH4-storage predictions with an RMSE of 26.8 and an R2 of 0.92 for testing.},

However, the design and fabrication of materials are often unsustainable and resource-intensive. Hence, we need a paradigm shift towards designing sustainable materials               in silico               . Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), is emerging within the sustainability agenda because it promises to benefit science and engineering through improved quality, performance, and predictive power. Here we present a new methodology to extend the application of AI to develop materials in an environmentally friendly way. We demonstrate successful materials development by combining design of experiments with a new machine learning module that comprises a support vector machine, an evolutionary algorithm, and a desirability function. We use our AI-based method to realize the sustainable electrochemical synthesis of a ZIF-8 metal\textendash organic framework and explore the hyperdimensional relationship between the synthesis parameters, product qualities, and process sustainability. The presented AI-based methodology paves the way for solving the challenge of the materials fabrication-sustainability nexus, and facilitates the paradigm shift from the wet lab to the wired lab.},

  abstract = {Metal\textendash organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials constructed from metal ions or clusters and multidentate organic ligands. Recently, the use of MOFs or MOF composites as catalysts for synergistic catalysis and tandem reactions has attracted increasing attention due to their tunable open metal centres, functional organic linkers, and active guest species in their pores. In this review, the applications of MOFs with multiple active sites in synergistic organic catalysis, photocatalysis and tandem reactions are discussed. These multifunctional MOFs can be categorized by the type of active centre as follows: (i) open metal centres and functional organic linkers in the MOF structure, (ii) active guest sites in the pores and active sites in the MOF structure, and (iii) bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) on MOF supports. The types of synergistic catalysis and tandem reactions promoted by multifunctional MOFs and their proposed mechanisms are presented in detail. Here, catalytic MOFs with a single type of active site and MOFs that only serve as supports to enhance substrate adsorption are not discussed.},

The isotherms obtained through volumetric or gravimetric experiments impart insight through their features but can also be analysed to determine material characteristics such as specific surface area, pore size distribution, surface energetics, or used for predicting mixture adsorption. The pyGAPS (Python General Adsorption Processing Suite) framework was developed to address the need for high-throughput processing of such adsorption data, independent of the data origin, while also being capable of presenting individual results in a user-friendly manner. It contains many common characterisation methods such as: Brunauer\textendash Emmett\textendash Teller and Langmuir surface area, t and {$\alpha$}s plots, pore size distribution calculations (Barrett\textendash Joyner\textendash Halenda, Dollimore\textendash Heal, Horvath\textendash Kawazoe, DFT/NLDFT kernel fitting), isosteric enthalpy calculations, ideal adsorbed solution theory~calculations, isotherm modelling and more, as well as the ability to import and store data from Excel, CSV, JSON and SQLite databases. In this work, a description of the capabilities of pyGAPS is presented. The code is then be used in two case studies: a routine characterisation of a UiO-66(Zr) sample and in the processing of an adsorption dataset of a commercial carbon (Takeda 5A) for applications in gas separation.},

It is also a key descriptor of optoelectronic properties of materials and is often used to assess the success of a synthesis. However, predicting the colour of a material based on its structure is challenging. In this work, we leverage subjective and categorical human assignments of colours to build a model that can predict the colour of compounds on a continuous scale. In the process of developing the model, we also uncover inadequacies in current reporting mechanisms. For example, we show that the majority of colour assignments are subject to perceptive spread that would not comply with common printing standards. To remedy this, we suggest and implement an alternative way of reporting colour\textemdash and chemical data in general. All data is captured in an objective, and standardised, form in an electronic lab notebook and subsequently automatically exported to a repository in open formats, from where it can be interactively explored by other researchers. We envision this to be key for a data-driven approach to chemical research.},

For example, bulky solvents are required that are size-excluded from the pores in the liquid, along with high concentrations of the porous component, but both of these factors may also contribute to higher viscosities, which are undesirable. Hence, the inherent multivariate nature of porous liquids makes them amenable to high-throughput optimisation strategies. Here we develop a high-throughput robotic workflow, encompassing the synthesis, characterisation and property testing of highly-soluble, vertex-disordered porous organic cages dissolved in a range of cavity-excluded solvents. As a result, we identified 29 cage\textendash solvent combinations that combine both higher cage-cavity concentrations and more acceptable carrier solvents than the best previous examples. The most soluble materials gave three times the pore concentration of the best previously reported scrambled cage porous liquid, as demonstrated by increased gas uptake. We were also able to explore alternative methods for gas capture and release, including liberation of the gas by increasing the temperature. We also found that porous liquids can form gels at higher concentrations, trapping the gas in the pores, which could have potential applications in gas storage and transportation.},

  abstract = {The materials genome initiative has led to the creation of a large (over a million) database of different classes of nanoporous materials. As the number of hypothetical materials that can, in principle, be experimentally synthesized is infinite, a bottleneck in the use of these databases for the discovery of novel materials is the lack of efficient computational tools to analyze them. Current approaches use brute-force molecular simulations to generate thermodynamic data needed to predict the performance of these materials in different applications, but this approach is limited to the analysis of tens of thousands of structures due to computational intractability. As such, it is conceivable and even likely that the best nanoporous materials for any given application have yet to be discovered both experimentally and theoretically. In this article, we seek a computational approach to tackle this issue by transitioning away from brute-force characterization to high-throughput screening methods based on big-data analysis, using the zeolite database as an example. For identifying and comparing zeolites, we used a topological data analysis-based descriptor (TD) recognizing pore shapes. For methane storage and carbon capture applications, our analyses seeking pairs of highly similar zeolites discovered good correlations between performance properties of a seed zeolite and the corresponding pair, which demonstrates the capability of TD to predict performance properties. It was also shown that when some top zeolites are known, TD can be used to detect other high-performing materials as their neighbors with high probability. Finally, we performed high-throughput screening of zeolites based on TD. For methane storage (or carbon capture) applications, the promising sets from our screenings contained high-percentages of top-performing zeolites: 45\% (or 23\%) of the top 1\% zeolites in the entire set. This result shows that our screening approach using TD is highly efficient in finding highperforming materials. We expect that this approach could easily be extended to other applications by simply adjusting one parameter, the size of the target gas molecule.},

In this work, we carried out high-throughput computational screening of a large number of computer-generated MTV-MOFs to assess their CO2 capture properties using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that functionalization enhances CO2 capture performance of MTV-MOFs when compared to their parent (unfunctionalized) counterparts, and the pore size plays a dominant role in determining the CO2 adsorption capabilities of MTV-MOFs irrespective of the combinations of the three functional groups (-F, -NH2, and -OCH3) that we investigated. We also found that the functionalization of parent MOFs with small pores led to larger enhancements in CO2 uptake and CO2/N2 selectivity than functionalization in larger-pore MOFs. Free energy contour maps are presented to visually compare the influence of linker functionalization between frameworks with large and small pores.},

We used Widom method to reduce significantly the simulation time of water adsorption, allowing us to shortlist 156 hydrophobic MOFs where water will not compete with the CWAs to get adsorbed. We then moved to grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to assess the removal capacity of CWAs. We selected the best candidates in terms of performance but also in terms of chemical stability and moved to synthesis and experimental breakthrough adsorption to probe the predicted, excellent performance.

  abstract = {The adsorption capacity on and the desorption from pure activated carbons, silica and NaX zeolite, of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (HMCTS or D3, a common siloxane impurity in biogases) has been evaluated in laboratory experiments using synthetic biogas. The adsorption mode of this molecule has also been investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. HMCTS adsorbs on silica by hydrogen bonding on the surface hydroxyl groups. However, its desorption up to 200 {$\smwhtcircle$}C by purging with nitrogen as well as by vacuum treatment, is incomplete, leaving surface hydroxyl groups partially affected. Limited desorption is observed also from activated carbons at temperatures between 20 and 200 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. On zeolite NaX molecular adsorption as well as reactive adsorption occurs, partial desorption being obtained by purging with nitrogen already at room temperature. In the three adsorbents, polymerization of HMCTS to silicone is found during adsorption in dynamic conditions. This is supposed to be the common cause of the only partial regenerability of all these solids after HMCTS adsorption.},

The accuracy of experimental crystal structures used in such calculations has a significant impact on the reliability of the results. In this work, we report structures optimized using periodic density functional theory (DFT) for more than 800 experimentally synthesized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Many MOFs changed significantly upon structural optimization, particularly materials that were crystallographically resolved in their solvated form. For each MOF, we simulated the adsorption of CH4 and CO2 using grand canonical Monte Carlo both before and after DFT optimization. The DFT optimization has a large impact on simulated gas adsorption in some cases. For example, CO2 loading at 1 bar changed by more than 25\% in over 25\% of the MOFs we considered.},

  abstract = {Recently a lot of attention has been focused on volatile organic silicon compounds (VOSiC) present in biogases. They induce costly problems due to silicate formation during biogas combustion in valorisation engine. The cost of converting landfill gas and digester gas into electricity is adversely affected by this undesirable presence. VOSiC in biogases spark off formation of silicate deposits in combustion chambers. They engender abrasion of the inner surfaces leading to serious damage, which causes frequent service interruptions, thus reducing the economic benefit of biogases. It is already known that these VOSiC originate from polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) hydrolysis. PDMS (silicones) are used in a wide range of consumer and industrial applications. PDMS are released into the environment through landfills and wastewater treatment plants. There is a lack of knowledge concerning PDMS biodegradation during waste storage. Consequently, understanding PDMS behaviour in landfill cells and in sludge digester is particularly important. In this article, we focused on microbial degradation of PDMS through laboratory experiments. Preliminary test concerning anaerobic biodegradation of various PDMS have been investigated. Results demonstrate that the biotic step has an obvious influence on PDMS biodegradation.},

  abstract = {{$\Delta$}9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principal psychoactive component of cannabis, and there is an urgent need to build lowcost and portable devices that can detect its presence from breath. Similarly to alcohol detectors, these tools can be used by law enforcement to determine driver intoxication and enforce safer and more regulated use of cannabis. In this work, we propose to use a class of microporous crystals, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), to selectively adsorb THC that can be later detected using optical, electrochemical, or fluorescence-based sensing methods. We computationally screened more than 5000 MOFs, highlighting the materials that have the largest affinity with THC, as well as the highest selectivity against water, showing that it is thermodynamically feasible for MOFs to adsorb THC from humid breath. We propose and compare different models for THC and different computational protocols to rank the promising materials, also presenting a novel approach to assess the permeability of a porous framework to nonspherical molecules. We identified three adsorption motifs in MOFs with high affinity to THC, which we refer to as ``narrow channels'', ``thick walls'', and ``parking spots''. Therefore, we expect our protocols and our findings to be generalizable for different classes of microporous materials and also for investigating the adsorption properties of other large molecules that, like THC, have a nonspherical shape.},

Machine learning (ML) algorithms trained on fundamental material properties can potentially provide quick and accurate methods for screening purposes. Prior efforts have focused on structural descriptors for use with ML. In this work, the use of chemical descriptors, in addition to structural descriptors, was introduced for adsorption analysis. Evaluation of structural and chemical descriptors coupled with various ML algorithms, including decision tree, Poisson regression, support vector machine and random forest, were carried out to predict methane uptake on hypothetical metal organic frameworks. To highlight their predictive capabilities, ML models were trained on 8\% of a data set consisting of 130,398 MOFs and then tested on the remaining 92\% to predict methane adsorption capacities. When structural and chemical descriptors were jointly used as ML input, the random forest model with 10-fold cross validation proved to be superior to the other ML approaches, with an R2 of 0.98 and a mean absolute percent error of about 7\%. The training and prediction using the random forest algorithm for adsorption capacity estimation of all 130,398 MOFs took approximately 2 h on a single personal computer, several orders of magnitude faster than actual molecular simulations on high-performance computing clusters.},

  abstract = {Methods for the removal of gaseous silicon compounds in biogases are presented. In laboratory studies, various solid adsorption materials and liquid absorption solutions were evaluated for their siloxane elimination efficiencies. Among the liquid sorbents studied, concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid were found to be especially potent siloxane removing agents at elevated temperature. Solid adsorbents tested include activated charcoal, carbopack B, Tenax TA, XAD II resins, molecular sieve 13X and silica gel. Apart from activated charcoal, silica gel showed especially high adsorption capacities of more than 100 mg/g for siloxanes. Furthermore, excellent thermal regeneration of the loaded material was possible. The efficiency of silica gel in removing gaseous siloxanes was verified at a sewage treatment plant, where an adsorption bed with silica gel was used for biogas drying. Other gas pretreatment installations studied included refrigeration condensers and adsorbent beds of meadow ore for the catalytic removal of hydrogen sulfide. In contrast to biogas drying by refrigeration, which had a poor effect on siloxane content, the installation of meadow ore adsorption beds resulted in a significant siloxane reduction of 31\textendash 75\%, depending on the site studied. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This rapid growth in the consumption of natural gas has led to increased CO               2               emissions from gas-fired power plants. To limit the contribution of fossil fuel combustion to atmospheric CO               2               levels, carbon capture and sequestration has been proposed as a potential emission mitigation strategy. However, despite extensive exploration of solid adsorbents for CO               2               capture, few studies have examined the performance of adsorbents in post-combustion capture processes specific to natural gas flue emissions. In this perspective, we emphasize the importance of considering gas-fired power plants alongside coal-fired plants in future analyses of carbon capture materials. We address specific challenges and opportunities related to adsorptive carbon capture from the emissions of gas-fired plants and discuss several promising candidate materials. Finally, we suggest experiments to determine the viability of new CO               2               capture materials for this separation. This broadening in the scope of current carbon capture research is urgently needed to accelerate the deployment of transformational carbon capture technologies.},

  abstract = {Accelerating progress in the discovery and deployment of advanced nanoporous materials relies on chemical insight and structure-property relationships for rational design. Because of the complexity of this problem, trial-and-error is heavily involved in the laboratory today. A cost-effective route to aid experimental materials discovery is to construct structure models of nanoporous materials in silico and use molecular simulations to rapidly test them and elucidate data-driven guidelines for rational design. For example, highly tunable nanoporous materials have shown promise as adsorbents for separating an industrially relevant gaseous mixture of xenon and krypton. In this work, we characterize, screen, and analyze the Nanoporous Materials Genome, a database of about 670 000 porous material structures, for candidate adsorbents for xenon/krypton separations. For over half a million structures, the computational resources required for a bruteforce screening using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations of Xe/Kr adsorption are prohibitive. To overcome the computational cost, we used a hybrid approach combining machine learning algorithms (random forests) with molecular simulations. We compared the results from our large-scale screening with simple pore models to rationalize the strong link between pore size and selectivity. With this insight, we then analyzed the anatomy of the binding sites of the most selective materials. These binding sites can be constructed from tubes, pockets, rings, or cages and are often composed of nondiscrete chemical fragments. The complexity of these binding sites emphasizes the importance of high-throughput computational screenings to identify optimal materials for a given application. Interestingly, our screening study predicts that the two most selective materials in the database are an aluminophosphate zeolite analogue and a calcium based coordination network, both of which have already been synthesized but not yet tested for Xe/Kr separations.},

The geometry of the cavity strongly influences their adsorptive selectivity. For comparing cages and predicting their adsorption properties, we embed/encode a set of 74 porous organic cage molecules into a low-dimensional, latent ``cage space'' on the basis of their intrinsic porosity. We first computationally scan each cage to generate a three-dimensional (3D) image of its porosity. Leveraging the singular value decomposition, in an unsupervised manner, we then learn across all cages an approximate, lower-dimensional subspace in which the 3D porosity images congregate. The ``eigencages'' are the set of orthogonal, characteristic 3D porosity images that span this lower-dimensional subspace, ordered in terms of importance. A latent representation/encoding of each cage follows by approximately expressing it as a combination of the eigencages. We show that the learned encoding captures salient features of the cavities of porous cages and is predictive of properties of the cages that arise from cavity shape. Our methods could be applied to learn latent representations of cavities within other classes of porous materials and of shapes of molecules in general.},

LFG, however, contains various trace constituents, some of which may pose problems during utilization. For example, siloxanes and halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can cause difficulties when present in the fuel of gas engines. In addition, many VOCs and mercury have harmful effects on human health, especially on the health of workers at landfill sites and people living near the landfills. Energy recovery from LFG is expected to make great progress in the near future, particularly in Asia, but we found little information on the trace constituents of LFG in this region. Therefore, we sought to characterize the trace components in LFG generated in two landfill sites in China and one site in Japan, to determine the typical concentrations of these trace components in LFG, and to compare their concentrations among landfill sites in Asia. We concluded that the trace components in LFG at the sites studied were mainly siloxanes generated from sewage sludge and harmful benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene compounds from petroleum products.},

The lack of a transferable intramolecular ZIF force field (FF) for use in classical simulations has previously made an accurate simulation of adsorbate diffusion in many ZIFs impossible. We resolve this problem by introducing a density functional theory parameterized force field (FF) for ZIFs named the intraZIF-FF, which includes perturbations to the class I force fields previously used to model ZIFs. This FF outperforms ad hoc force fields at predicting ab initio relative energies and atomic forces taken from fully periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of SALEM-2, ZIF-7, ZIF-8, and ZIF-90. We use the intraZIF-FF to predict the infinite dilution selfdiffusion coefficients of 30 adsorbates with molecular diameters ranging from 2.66 to 7.0 \AA{} in these 4 ZIFs. These results greatly increase the number of adsorbates for which accurate information about molecular diffusion in ZIFs is available.},

  abstract = {Mesoporous materials suffer from poor crystallinity and hydrolytic stability, lack of chemical diversity, insufficient pore accessibility, complex synthesis, and toxicity issues. Here the association of Zroxo clusters and isophthalate via a homometallic-multicluster-dot strategy results in a robust mesoporous metal-organic framework, denoted as MIP-206 (MIP stands for materials of the Institute of Porous Materials of Paris), that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. MIP-206, with a combination of Zr6 and Zr12 oxo-cluster inorganic building units into a single structure, exhibits meso-channels of ca. 2.6 nm and displays excellent chemical stability. Owing to the abundant variety of functionalized isophthalic acid linkers, the chemical environment of MIP-206 can be tuned without hampering pore accessibility. MIP-206 loaded with palladium nanoparticles acts as an efficient and durable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of formic acid, outperforming benchmark mesoporous materials. This paves the way toward the utilization of MIP-206 as a mesoporous platform for a wide range of potential applications.},

Various technologies, including adsorption, absorption, membrane separation and biological degradation, are used for the removal of VMS in biogas purification process. This work aims to summarize the recent advances of these technologies. Their advantages/disadvantages and factors that affect the removal efficiency of VMS are analyzed and discussed. Particular attention is paid to adsorption for its highest purification efficiency among the current VMS control technologies. Decrease of the adsorbed capacity under high humidity atmosphere and incomplete desorption are unavoidable conundrums at the present stage. The origination and influenced pathways of these issues are elaborated. Finally, research directions of these technologies for a further development are suggested to fulfill a high VMS removal efficiency and deep understanding of mechanisms.},

We evaluated their usage data and patterns, physico-chemical properties, toxicology, partitioning and degradation, methods of detection, and concentrations. The use of cVMS as an intermediate in the formation of silicone polymers, personal care and household products has resulted in their widespread environmental exposure; they have been detected in biogas, air, water, soil, biosolid, sediment, and biota samples. Modeled and experimental results suggest that cVMS may be subject to long-range atmospheric transport, but have low potential to contaminate the Arctic. For D4 and D5, there was no evidence of trophic biomagnification in aquatic food webs, while some aquatic organisms demonstrated a high degree of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation. High concentrations of cVMS observed in indoor air and biosolids resulted from point sources. Concentrations of cVMS in water, sediment, and soil were all below their noobserved-effect-concentrations.},

  abstract = {The number of published materials science articles has increased manyfold over the past few decades. Now, a major bottleneck in the materials discovery pipeline arises in connecting new results with the previously established literature. A potential solution to this problem is to map the unstructured raw text of published articles onto structured database entries that allow for programmatic querying. To this end, we apply text mining with named entity recognition (NER) for large-scale information extraction from the published materials science literature. The NER model is trained to extract summary-level information from materials science documents, including inorganic material mentions, sample descriptors, phase labels, material properties and applications, as well as any synthesis and characterization methods used. Our classifier achieves an accuracy (f1) of 87\%, and is applied to information extraction from 3.27 million materials science abstracts. We extract more than 80 million materials-science-related named entities, and the content of each abstract is represented as a database entry in a structured format. We demonstrate that simple database queries can be used to answer complex ``meta-questions'' of the published literature that would have previously required laborious, manual literature searches to answer. All of our data and functionality has been made freely available on our Github (https://github.com/materialsintelligence/matscholar) and website (http://matscholar.com), and we expect these results to accelerate the pace of future materials science discovery.},

A database containing 1039 data points showing the effects of 15 input variables (grouped in four as support properties, preparation method, amine properties and operational variables) over two performance variables as CO2 adsorption capacity and amine efficiency (CO2 captured/ amino groups involved) was constructed. Box and whisker plots were applied (as a part of exploratory data analysis) to determine how various input variables influence the performance variables. Moreover, decision tree classification was used to determine the relative significance of the input variables and the possible combinations of these variables leading to high performance (to deduce heuristics for high CO2 uptake). It was found from the exploratory data analysis that amine density was the most significant variable affecting the adsorption capacity whereas remaining pore volume and adsorption temperature were the most influential variables in case of amine efficiency. Furthermore, various combinations of input variables leading to high CO2 capture performance were revealed through the decision tree analysis, all of which may be used as guidelines for future studies in this area.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth in the global energy demand for space cooling requires the development of more efficient environmental chillers for which adsorption-based cooling systems can be utilized. Here, in this contribution, we explore sorbents for chiller use via a pore-engineering concept to construct analogs of the 1-dimensional pore metal-organic framework MOF-74 by using elongated organic linkers and stereochemistry control. The prepared pore-engineered MOFs show remarkable equilibrium adsorption of the selected fluorocarbon refrigerant that is translated to a modeled adsorption-based refrigeration cycle. To probe molecular level interactions at the origin of these unique adsorption properties for this series of Ni-MOFs, we combined in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared techniques, and molecular simulations. Our results reveal the coordination of fluorine (of CH2F in R134a) to the nickel(II) open metal centers at low pressures for each Ni-MOF analog and provide insight into the pore filling mechanism for the full range of the adsorption isotherms. The newly designed Ni-TPM demonstrates exceptional R134a adsorption uptake compared to its parent microporous Ni-MOF-74 due to larger engineered pore size/volume. The application of this adsorption performance toward established chiller conditions yields a working capacity increase for Ni-TPM of about 400\% from that of Ni-MOF-74, which combined with kinetics directly correlates to both a higher coefficient of performance and a higher average cooling capacity generated in a modeled chiller.},
